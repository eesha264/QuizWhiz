## 2. Partially Implemented / Limitations

- [ ] **Security Rules**: 
    - *Current Status*: Basic rules exist, but the current implementation allows public read/write in some areas to facilitate the demo.
    - *Missing*: Strict validation of data types and ownership in `firestore.rules`.
- [ ] **Timer Synchronization**:
    - *Current Status*: Relies on client-side `setTimeout` synced with a start timestamp.
    - *Limitation*: Susceptible to client clock drift or manipulation.
- [ ] **Error Handling**:
    - *Current Status*: Basic "Quiz not found" or "Join failed" messages.
    - *Missing*: Robust handling of network disconnections during an active game (reconnection logic).
- [ ] **Question Types**:
    - *Current Status*: Only supports single-select Multiple Choice.
    - *Missing*: True/False, Multi-select, Open Text input.

## 3. Planned / Future Improvements

- [ ] **Server-Side Scoring**: Move scoring logic to Firebase Cloud Functions to prevent client-side cheating.
- [ ] **Edit Quiz**: Ability to modify questions in an existing quiz (currently can only Create or Delete).
- [ ] **Rich Media**: Support for images or videos in questions.
- [ ] **Persistent Participant Profiles**: Allow users to create accounts to track their history and stats across multiple quizzes.
- [ ] **Export Data**: Admin ability to export results/leaderboard to CSV.
- [ ] **Team Mode**: Allow participants to join as teams rather than individuals.
- [ ] **Question Bank**: Ability to reuse questions from previous quizzes.
